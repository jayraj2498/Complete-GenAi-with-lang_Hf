1) with Respect to tools & agent it make your GenAi application Amazing by solving complex problems  

Inside We will try to integrate genAi applicaton with mulituple tools 


Tools : tools are the interface , that agent , chain & LLM to interact with World 

Ex : Langchain procvide one tools called ArXiv 
ArXiv= whether you require any information about any reserch paper so, you can have intraction and you get information  
wikipedia =  we can also use wikipedia for this purpose 

like some of tools are already provided like that also you can create you own cuatom tools 


conclusion = if LLm will not have information about any subject , so LLM model will do 
it will go and intract with this kind of tools and based on input it will get the response 



Agents : if we want to exceute use all the tools and exceute it so , we require also important component calles as "Agents"
